- I have enabled SwaggerUI and also added a console program called 'BattleShip.Console' to run the program.
- BattleShip.Console can be used to run the program easily.
- The 'BattleShip.API' is the api which contains the program.
- The 'BattleShip.Test' contains some unit tests.
- Exceptions are handled globally using a custom middleware.
- I have referenced some resources on the internet to get the idea about the random class generation to cover the logic of placing ships on the board.
